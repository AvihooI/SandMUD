Prototype Phase Backlog:

SandTcpServer:
	a) seems to be functionally complete
	b) requires further development and testing to support a significantly high amount of connections
	c) needs to have some sort of server configuration
	d) if adopted, will move out of prototype phase to pre-production which will involve more formal documentation

SandDataGenerator:
	a) does its job
	b) requires further testing as well as some refactoring
	c) will require re-implementation to work more efficiently

SandDataProcessor: 
	a) works as expected
	b) very premature at the moment and requires more understanding of its responsibilities

Solution wide points:

a) SandDataGenerator and SandDataProcessor need to be unified to a single project called SandData (though keep their namespaces)
b) Projects need to have a shared namespace called "SandMUD.SandInfrastructure" which basically encompasses the most bottom layer in the MUD system
c) Should consider a persistence system under the infrastructure layer
d) Once the infrastructure layer is done (the useful code is refactored, extracted, properly documented), the prototyping phase will be over and the modelling phase will begin
