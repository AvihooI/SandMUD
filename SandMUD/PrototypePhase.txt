Prototype Phase Backlog:

SandTcpServer:
	a) might require further development and testing to support a significantly high amount of connections
	b) in Pre-Production: requires formal documentation
	c) incremented to 0.0.0.2

SandDataGenerator:
	a) does its job
	b) requires further testing as well as some refactoring
	c) will require re-implementation to work more efficiently
	d) needs to be renamed to SandANSI

SandDataProcessor: 
	a) works as expected
	b) very premature at the moment and requires more understanding of its responsibilities
	c) should be dropped because the issues it solves can be addressed with LINQ

SandModel:
	a) contains the mud model entities

SandPersistence:
	a) needs some thinking as to what exactly its responsibilities need to be
	b) will use the ESENT library via a PersistentDictionary 

Solution wide points:

a) SandDataGenerator and SandDataProcessor need to be unified to a single project called SandData (though keep their namespaces)
b) Projects need to have a shared namespace called "SandMUD.SandInfrastructure" which basically encompasses the most bottom layer in the MUD system
c) Should consider a persistence system under the infrastructure layer => A SandPersistence project
d) Once the infrastructure layer is done (the useful code is refactored, extracted, properly documented), the prototyping phase will be over and the modelling phase will begin
