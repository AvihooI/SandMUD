Prototype Phase Backlog:

SandTcpServer:
	a) might require further development and testing to support a significantly high amount of connections
	b) in Pre-Production: requires formal documentation
	c) incremented to 0.0.0.2

SandDataGenerator:
	a) does its job
	b) requires further testing as well as some refactoring
	c) will require re-implementation to work more efficiently
	d) needs to be renamed to SandANSI

SandModel:
	a) contains the mud model entities
	b) needs to be finalized

SandPersistence:
	a) needs some thinking as to what exactly its responsibilities need to be
	b) uses entity framework
	c) proper credentials needed for remote DB
	d) further define the entities using the fluent api

Solution wide points:

a) SandDataGenerator and SandDataProcessor need to be unified to a single project called SandData (though keep their namespaces)
b) Should consider a persistence system under the infrastructure layer => A SandPersistence project - SOLVED WITH entity framework
d) Once the infrastructure layer is done (the useful code is refactored, extracted, properly documented), the prototyping phase will be over and the modelling phase will begin
