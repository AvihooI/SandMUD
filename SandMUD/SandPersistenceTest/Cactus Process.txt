Initial sequential phases:

Initiation phase: formulate Idea -> Learn crucial tools and technologies -> Experiment with tools and technologies
Protoyping phase: Identify key areas -> Prototype identified parts -> Extract useful elements from prototypes
Model phase: Formulate a Definition-of-Done (DoD) -> create product Backlog -> describe general Architecture -> create a development Order

Core iterative phases:

Iteration phase: Select item from backlong (based on the development order) ->
	Breakdown backlog item into smaller items (that can be developed discreetly)
	OR
	(optional) write Interfaces -> (optional) write Tests -> implement Code -> (optional) Unit Test -> Finish* item in backlog ->
		 Repeat iteration phase
		 OR
		 Resume integration phase

Integration phase: 
	Integrate relevant items -> Integration Test -> Adjust items to fit together -> Finish* integration process ->
		Resume iteration phase
		OR
		Resume introspection phase

Introspection phase:
	Inspect the current state of the project (profiling, architecture, design patterns, etc) -> Refactor code -> Optimize code -> Fix errors -> Re-Architect project ->
		Add/Remove items from backlog
		OR
		Resume iteration phase
		OR
		Resume integration phase
		OR
		Resume release phase

Additional auxiliary phases/stages:

Release phase: Alpha/Beta testing (quality assurance) -> Finish* current build -> Document project -> Increment version -> Release project ->
	Resume iterative phases (Iteration, Integration, Introspection)
	OR
	Change project stage (from development to maintenance or expansion, from maintenance to expansion or death)

Development stage: In the development stage, the project aims to increase its functionality by adding more features

Maintenance stage: In the maintenance stage, the iterative phases focus primarily on fixing bugs and optimizing/refactoring the code rather than adding new features

Expansion stage: In the expansion stage the initial sequential are re-used to expand the project significantly (the expansion stage is basically a non-initial development stage)

Death stage: Final thorough documentation -> Identify re-usable elements in the project
		
*Finish depends on a certain definition of done (DoD) that is decided upon in the Model phase
